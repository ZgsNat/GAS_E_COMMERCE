# GAS_E_COMMERCE
GAS E-Commerce   -  The e-commerce gas shop software system aims to provide a user-friendly online platform for customers to purchase gas products conveniently. It serves as a digital marketplace connecting gas suppliers with end-users, facilitating seamless transactions and efficient order management. The software system will be developed to support the operations of a gas shop, offering a wide range of gas products, secure payment processing, and inventory management capabilities.

## Project
